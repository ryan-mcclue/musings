Thermal imaging coupled with camera more 'deterministic/maintainable' than AI vision

There are of course international standards (IEC 60601, or IEC 62304) that you have 
to follow in order to get your device CE/FDA approval.
These standards usually require to provide a lot of documentation and to pass a 
series of tests in order to verify that your device is working as intended 
and it's not dangerous.

could even be simplex (one way only)
full-duplex can still be serial, requiring at least two wires (duplex meaning bidirectional)
serial (synchronous with clock data; asynchronous) + parallel 

If you put "used Bluetooth" then I would expect you to talk about which transceivers you used, what the api was like (deficiencies it had, how low level, how was it good), and of course a high level overview of where the Bluetooth spec ends and application begins.

Simply bieng able to say "I don't know, but I do know that in the spec/experience it says xyz, so maybe it would do abc, but I would have to look for jkl to be sure." is huge.

BUTTON BOX 3D PRINT:
* print out small test part with holes to test if button/screw/etc. inserts fit correctly
* consider leaving holes in 3D scaffolding for making wiring easier
* for stylistic finish, can print a separate plate with different resin and attach with hot glue
* will have a bottom plate to account for wiring (have threaded inserts (male-to-female) to account for box moving about when pressing a button)
1. solder wires to buttons
2. solder wires to mcu
3. secure mcu

addressable rgb, each LED has serial chip with a serial port in and serial port out that it funnels through the chain
(interesting option of having a light display at sunset)
using PlatformIO (python under the hood) very slow.
perhaps though, it's useful for finding libraries or possible environment options to explore like unit testing
BOARD-SELECTION: (want a board with WiFi and a builtin display?)
IMPORTANT: chip cost may be $4, board cost $15
go with ARM (although ESP32 much more powerful than Atmel, e.g. RAM, peripherals, frequency similar cost)

LEDS:
tricolor led can be any 3 colours. RGB LED is specific colours
we power level appropriate from cable, board will enter program mode automatically
resolution of PWM setup dependent on the frequency set up for it 
(e.g. resolution of 8 gives 100% duty cycle of 255)
```
red_led_duty_cycle(pwm_max_val - red_component);
green_led_duty_cycle(pwm_max_val - green_component);
blue_led_duty_cycle(pwm_max_val - blue_component);
```
TODO: is brightness of PWM determined by duty cycle?
If so, then a PWM LED fade should just be duty cycle, or should it be colour as well?

DISPLAY:
useful to display FPS (might only need to display this say, every 250ms as oppose to every frame), 
power consumption (perhaps unscaled power, i.e. power if not performing alterations; perhaps only bright LED is power throttling)
technology, size, connection
as various permutations of these, have various controller permutations 
e.g. SH1107_I2C, SSD1306_SPI, etc. (we probably want a library to draw lines, shapes, fonts, etc.)

note, if using newlib, will still have a _start

May compile for different architectures in embedded for different product lines 
e.g. low-end fit bit, high-end fitbit

Compile with different compilers to see performance benefits at end.
Also possible may have to use a particular compiler for specific hardware.

In reality, don't want an RTOS if timing very critical.
Most MCU don't even have multiple cores so adding software overhead 
(or are there additional hardware to emulate cores?)
Even without RTOS, will most likely have some timer and separation of tasks.
Main overall benefit of RTOS is consistent driver interfaces across multiple mcus 
(useful for say complex bluetooth/ethernet stacks etc.)
Most mcus are overpowered for what they do, so using an RTOS is probably a good idea.

# Language of the People

https://drh.github.io/lcc/

Garbage collection replaces us with a 'search' of our memory and decides when to free
So really only use if you can't figure out when to free something
This search is not free

No language implements a feature that determines a memory footprint, i.e. how much memory we use

Know OS specific forking (process launching), file checking/reading/writing, IPCs

Steps for adding new feature: 
create a new file, e.g. commands.c and include it in main.c (order it before things that will use it) 
then do a git commit.
This gets us off on a nice feeling
In new file, create function with barebones functionality that can then be inserted into location and called/tested

Simple word parser use `at[1] != '\0' && at[1] == 'a'`

Simple single line parser:
First separate by whitespace with `while (at[0] != '\0'); break` and `eat_spaces(), find_ch_from_left()`

3D printing ideas:

michael ee for RTOS: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLYZoEqwvzM35p2Kc7bk7bkwxLtTVwpvy 

A real time scheduling algorithm is deterministic (not necessarily fast), i.e. it absolutely must
(soft time is it should)
(real time processing means virtually immediately)
So, a higher priority task will preempt lower priority tasks
FreeRTOS will have a default idle task created by the kernel that is always running
(this idle task gives indication of a low-power mode for free?)

middleware extends OS functionality, drivers give OS functionality

freeRTOS makes money through some commercial licenses (with support), 
middleware (tcp/ip stacks, cli etc.)

TODO: setting freeRTOS interrupt priorities is sometimes done wrong?
tasks are usually infinite loops

freeRTOS is more barebones (only 3 files) and effectively just a scheduler (so has timers, priorities) 
and communication primitives between threads
In most embedded programs, sensors are monitored periodically. Time and functionality are closely related 
For small programs super loop is fine.
However, when creating large programs, this time dependency greatly increases complexity.
So, a priority based real-time scheduler can be used to reduce this time complexity. 
(priority over time-slice more efficient in most cases, as if not operating, can go to sleep)
In addition, schedular allows for logical separation of components (concurrent team development) 
Also allows easy utilisation of changing hardware, e.g. multiple processor cores
COTS (commercial-off-the-shelf) as opposed to bespoke


SEPARATE API CALLS TO AVOID LOW PRIORITY CORRUPTING BY BEING INTERRUPTED BY HIGH PRIORITY
Define a context structure that will hold api call information

typedef struct file_api_params_s
{
    uint8_t api_opcode;
    uint8_t control_opcode;
    uint8_t file_handle;
    semaphore sem;
    void * param1;
    size_t param2;
} file_api_params_t;

Depending on the RTOS you can actually define your messages and message pool ahead of time - or you'll be providing a pointer to the parameter structure in your message
file_api_params_t file_api_pool[n]; //where n = number of tasks that can access the file system + 1;

Each api function does the following:
   - allocates a free param structure from the pool
   - populates the parameters from the api call
   - initializes the semaphore
   - allocates and initializes a message to send to the file system task
   - adds the message to the queue
   - wait for the semaphore

The filesystem task does the following:
   - waits for messages from the message queue
   - checks the message validity and that the sender still is valid (for some systems that have bad behavior if the semaphore api does not check for validity)
   - performs the requested operation
   - increments the semaphore
   - goes back to waiting for a message
So, filesystem task is assigned high priority

If taskA dependent on taskB, taskB should be of higher priority than taskA 



zephyr more of an RTOS a step towards linux with lots of drivers e.g. LVGL, LittleFS, etc. 
(with this comes a lot more configuration hassle)


TODO: zephyr series (perhaps better to do this first as an RTOS as more modern resources than FreeRTOS?)

want to make something like stargate wheel

first step in embedded debugging commandments;
thou shalt check voltage 
(e.g. check 5V going to LCD by placing multimeter on soldered pin heads)

we can see in x86 (wikichips), instruction and data separate from L2 cache
arm SoC block diagram (datasheet), see d-bus and i-bus to RAM
introduce things like CCM (core coupled cache) 
and ART (adaptive real-time accelerator) that add some more harvard like instruction things
essentially, more busses instead of more cores like in x86, 
(i.e. a lot more than just a CPU to be concerned with)
also have more debug hardware
don't really know why cortex-m4 has MPU

AXIM, AHB and APB ARM specific
will have a bus matrix (which allows different peripherals to communicate via master and slave ports by requesting and sending data)
off this, have AHB (higher frequency and higher bandwidth).
like to think of AHB as host bus as it feeds into APBs via a bridge. APB1 normally half frequency of APB2
we can see that DMA can go directly to APB without going through bus matrix
So, relevent for speed and clock concerns going through which bus?
Also to know if we are DMA'ing something and CPUing something, they
are not going to be fighting on the same bus, i.e. spread out load
lower power peripherals on lower frequency busses?
this level of knowledge further emphasises need to know hardware to understand what is going on

Can be implemented to support say an RJ45 connector

stm32 datasheet and reference manual (documents of different depths about same mcu) nomenclature
will have 'Application Notes' that detail specific features like CCM RAM
datasheet will often be related to a family, e.g. stm32f429xx.
therefore, at the front will have a table comparing memory, number of gpios, etc. for particulars

1. **Documentation**
   Generalities such as *Debug Interface* or *Procedure Call Standard*
   Architecture specifics such as *armv7m*
   Micro-architecture specifics such as *cortex-m4*
   Micro-controller specifics such as *stm32f429zi*
   Board specifics such as pin-out diagram and schematic
2. **BSP**
   This can be done via an IDE such as STM32CubeMX to create an example project Makefile.
   Alternatively can be done via a command line application such as libopencm3.
3. **Targets**
   Disable hardware fpu instructions and enable libgloss for simulator. Ensure main() call ordering mock test working 
   Enable nano libc with no system calls for target
4. **Flashing and Debugging**
   Coordinate *JLink/STLink* probe and board pin-outs
   Ascertain board debug firmware and determine if reflashing required, e.g. *STLinkReflash*
   Preferable to use debugger software such as *Ozone* that automates flashing.
   If not, determine flash software such as *JLinkExe*, *stlink-tools*, *openocd*, *nrfjprog* etc.
   Coordinate debugger software such as *QTCreator* with qemu gdb server
5. **Hardware Tools**
   Measure voltage, current, resistance/continuity/diode with multimeter?
   Oscilloscope for ...
   Logic analyser for, SPI and I2C

(HSPI is high speed parallel interface)

6. **Protocol**
  USB port probably in-built serial port

astable means no stable states, i.e. is not predominatley low or high, e.g. square wave, sine wave etc.
oscillator generates wave (could be for carrier or clock)

RC (resistor-capacitor) oscillator generates sine wave by charging and discharging periodically (555 astable timer)
internal mcu oscillators typically RC, so subject to frequency variability

Max out the HCLK in the clock diagram as we are not running off battery.
Will have clock sources, e.g. HSI, HSE, PLL. output of these is SYSCLK.
SYSCLK is what would use to calculate cpu instruction cycles.

a clock is an oscillator with a counter that records number of cycles since being initialised

Crystal generates stable frequency
PLL is type of clock circuit that allows for high frequency, reliable clock generation (setup also affords easy clock duplication and clock manipulation)
So, PLL system could have RC or crystal input
Feeding into it is a reference input (typically a crystal oscillator) which goes into a voltage controlled oscillator to output frequency
The feedback of the output frequency into the initial phase detector can be changed
Adding dividers/pre-scalers into this circuit allows to get programmable voltage.
So, a combination of stable crystal (however generate relatively slow signal, e.g. 100MHz) and high frequency RC oscillators (a type of VCO; voltage controlled oscillator)

openocd -f /usr/share/openocd/scripts/interface/jlink.cfg -f /usr/share/openocd/scripts/target/stm32f4x.cfg
should open a tcp port on 3333 for gdb

The CPU architecture will have an exception (a cpu interrupt) model. Here, reset behaviour will be defined.
the 32 bit arm cortex-m4 has FPU (a application, m for microcontroller, r high performance real time)
TODO(Ryan): avr vs arm vs rsic-v vs x86 vs powerpc vs sparc vs mips
(what motivations brought about these architectures?)
as often harvard archicture (why?)
Von Neumann, RAM (variables, data, stack) + ROM (code/constants) + I/O all on same CPU bus.
Harvard has ICode bus for ROM, and a SystemBus for RAM + I/O. 
This allows operations to occur simultaneously. So, why use Von Neumann?
it is labelled as an evaluation board
different boards use different ICDI (in-circuit debug interfaces) to flash through SWD via usb-b
e.g. texas instruments use stellaris, stm32 ST-link
is fixed point used anymore?
TODO(Ryan): Why is a floating pin also called high impedance?
To avoid power dissipation and unknown state, 
drive with external source, e.g. ground or voltage.

Pull-up/down resistors are to used for unconnected input pins to avoid floating state
So, a pull-down will have the pin (when in an unconnected state) to ground, i.e. 0V when switch is not on

IMPORTANT: Although enabling internal resistors, 
must look at board schematic as external resistors might overrule

Vdd (drain, power supply to chip)
Vcc (collector, subsection of chip, i.e. supply voltage of circuit)
Vss (sink, ground)
Vee (emitter, ground)

the sparsity of linux can make configuration vary
e.g bluez stack -> modify policies

for long range, LoRa or sigfox
essentially tradeoffs between power and data rate
ieee 802.11 group for WLANs (wifi - high data rate), 
802.15 for WPANs; 802.15.1 (bluetooth - le variant - heavily used in audio), 
802.15.4 low data rate (zigbee implements this standard)


unlike windows msdn, linux documentation is mostly source code (not good as if not fast/easy, not used). 
so, essential to have something like ctags and compile from source (sed -e "s/-Werror//g" -i *.make)
source and unit tests are documentation in many linux sources

xor with itself sets to 0
