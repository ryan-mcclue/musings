TODO: Filters, e.g. low-pass, high-pass
Seems use to reduce data processing, as only have to operate on a subset of data, e.g. <1500Hz? 
You will always need a lowpass filter before you quantize your signals. This filter is called an anti-aliasing filter and will prevent you from sampling high frequencies as low frequencies(shannon-nyquist sample theorem). If you don't have this filter, and your signal contains frequencies above half the sample rate, you will get false signals.

Tell them HOW you would find it if you don’t know. That’s the important part.

https://apollolabsblog.hashnode.dev/how-to-estimate-your-embedded-iot-device-power-consumption
You need to get a power monitor. Then you can enable different components and see what they pull relative to base draw. 
e.g. establish a baseline for idle system, then enable some component and check the difference from idle.
e.g. log power usage during a wireless transmission
In this case, you won’t actually use a battery. You wire up the system to the power monitor which acts like the battery.

software reset It will (should) behave exactly as if it has just been powered on, except that RAM retains values that were set before software reset. 
if your goal is to avoid reinitializing variables After software reset, then you'll need eeprom to save a reset-counter variable.
no need for an eeprom, simply define a memory region in normal ram as noinit (maybe called differently depending on linker/compiler). the startup code then won't touch it, except you explicitly tell it to do so.
I use this to keep track of error codes, that need to persist a soft reset but gets wiped after a hard reset.
I have done this with IAR (.icf linker files) and also GCC (.ld linker files).

Yes you need what’s called a « watchdog strategy », defining what your watchdog is monitoring and why it’s worth resetting if it goes wrong.
You can either run the watchdog with the highest priority, and then the register will be serviced about a thousand times a second.
Or at the lowest priority, and if ever your system becomes lagged, then it reboots, even if everything works. It all depends what is important for you.


If you can't think of things to use 76 I/O pins for, you haven't designed any real products.
The one I've got a reference up for right now is a controller for an LED hula hoop. 
It has about 30 I/Os - 4 for SPI flash, 8 for the WiFi module's SPI plus control lines and IRQ, 2 for IR comms, 3 for the motion sensor I2C and IRQ, sleep button, 2 battery charger status lines, 3 for LED data and clock, power control signals for the LEDs and IR receiver, USB VBUS detection, battery voltage monitoring, and a serial debug output.
And that's for a device with no parallel interfaces (e.g. LCD). Most of those I/Os don't involve a lot of CPU time. 
Things like the charger status signals can be interrupts, or polled a few times a second. 
Some of them are only needed for proper reset sequencing of peripherals. 
Anything involving high-speed transfers uses DMA - the WiFi module, SPI flash, and LED output can all be running simultaneously at full speed without taking up CPU cycles.

Two days later, you're trying to decide which peripherals can be multiplexed because you have no more pins available.
It's amazing how fast 50 pins needed turns into 120 pins needed. Even simple ICs sometimes give you so many options that they could burn 6 or 7 IOs.

You just need set your control loop interrupt priority so that it is lower priority (higher number on Cortex-M) than configMAX_SYSCALL_INTERRUPT_PRIORITY
There is no need to run the control loop using the RTOS master tick. Just use another timer, then have the ISR signal your control loop thread. You can use this up to 100 - 200 kHz with STM32H7. Above that you need to put the control code in the ISR itself.

There are of course international standards (IEC 60601, or IEC 62304) that you have 
to follow in order to get your device CE/FDA approval.
These standards usually require to provide a lot of documentation and to pass a 
series of tests in order to verify that your device is working as intended 
and it's not dangerous.

If you put "used Bluetooth" then I would expect you to talk about which transceivers you used, what the api was like (deficiencies it had, how low level, how was it good), and of course a high level overview of where the Bluetooth spec ends and application begins.

by powering board with pins, can ensure enough current is passing to it
can simultaneously connect USB cable and will defer to power pins over it?

note, if using newlib, will still have a _start

May compile for different architectures in embedded for different product lines 
e.g. low-end fit bit, high-end fitbit

Compile with different compilers to see performance benefits at end.
Also possible may have to use a particular compiler for specific hardware.

In reality, don't want an RTOS if timing very critical.
Most MCU don't even have multiple cores so adding software overhead 
(or are there additional hardware to emulate cores?)
Even without RTOS, will most likely have some timer and separation of tasks.
Main overall benefit of RTOS is consistent driver interfaces across multiple mcus 
(useful for say complex bluetooth/ethernet stacks etc.)
Most mcus are overpowered for what they do, so using an RTOS is probably a good idea.

tamper response usually done with a button on the board that gets activated when case opens
this will trigger an interrupt handled by RTC (real time clock)

embedded systems special purpose, constrained,

challenges are testabilty and software/hardware comprimises for optimisation problem solving, e.g. bit-banging or cheap mcu, external timer or in-built timer, adding hardware increases power consumption, e.g. ray tracing card or just rasterisation, big.LITTLE clusters
1/4 scalar performance for 1/2 power consumption good tradeoff

# Language of the People

https://drh.github.io/lcc/

Garbage collection replaces us with a 'search' of our memory and decides when to free
So really only use if you can't figure out when to free something
This search is not free

No language implements a feature that determines a memory footprint, i.e. how much memory we use

Know OS specific forking (process launching), file checking/reading/writing, IPCs

Steps for adding new feature: 
create a new file, e.g. commands.c and include it in main.c (order it before things that will use it) 
then do a git commit.
This gets us off on a nice feeling
In new file, create function with barebones functionality that can then be inserted into location and called/tested

Simple word parser use `at[1] != '\0' && at[1] == 'a'`

Simple single line parser:
First separate by whitespace with `while (at[0] != '\0'); break` and `eat_spaces(), find_ch_from_left()`

michael ee for RTOS: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLYZoEqwvzM35p2Kc7bk7bkwxLtTVwpvy 

A real time scheduling algorithm is deterministic (not necessarily fast), i.e. it absolutely must
(soft time is it should)
(real time processing means virtually immediately)
So, a higher priority task will preempt lower priority tasks
FreeRTOS will have a default idle task created by the kernel that is always running
(this idle task gives indication of a low-power mode for free?)

middleware extends OS functionality, drivers give OS functionality

freeRTOS makes money through some commercial licenses (with support), 
middleware (tcp/ip stacks, cli etc.)

TODO: setting freeRTOS interrupt priorities is sometimes done wrong?
tasks are usually infinite loops

freeRTOS is more barebones (only 3 files) and effectively just a scheduler (so has timers, priorities) 
and communication primitives between threads
In most embedded programs, sensors are monitored periodically. Time and functionality are closely related 
For small programs super loop is fine.
However, when creating large programs, this time dependency greatly increases complexity.
So, a priority based real-time scheduler can be used to reduce this time complexity. 
(priority over time-slice more efficient in most cases, as if not operating, can go to sleep)
In addition, schedular allows for logical separation of components (concurrent team development) 
Also allows easy utilisation of changing hardware, e.g. multiple processor cores
COTS (commercial-off-the-shelf) as opposed to bespoke


SEPARATE API CALLS TO AVOID LOW PRIORITY CORRUPTING BY BEING INTERRUPTED BY HIGH PRIORITY
Define a context structure that will hold api call information

typedef struct file_api_params_s
{
    uint8_t api_opcode;
    uint8_t control_opcode;
    uint8_t file_handle;
    semaphore sem;
    void * param1;
    size_t param2;
} file_api_params_t;

Depending on the RTOS you can actually define your messages and message pool ahead of time - or you'll be providing a pointer to the parameter structure in your message
file_api_params_t file_api_pool[n]; //where n = number of tasks that can access the file system + 1;

Each api function does the following:
   - allocates a free param structure from the pool
   - populates the parameters from the api call
   - initializes the semaphore
   - allocates and initializes a message to send to the file system task
   - adds the message to the queue
   - wait for the semaphore

The filesystem task does the following:
   - waits for messages from the message queue
   - checks the message validity and that the sender still is valid (for some systems that have bad behavior if the semaphore api does not check for validity)
   - performs the requested operation
   - increments the semaphore
   - goes back to waiting for a message
So, filesystem task is assigned high priority

If taskA dependent on taskB, taskB should be of higher priority than taskA

first step in embedded debugging commandments;
thou shalt check voltage 
(e.g. check 5V going to LCD by placing multimeter on soldered pin heads)

we can see in x86 (wikichips), instruction and data separate from L2 cache
arm SoC block diagram (datasheet), see d-bus and i-bus to RAM
introduce things like CCM (core coupled cache) 
and ART (adaptive real-time accelerator) that add some more harvard like instruction things
essentially, more busses instead of more cores like in x86, 
(i.e. a lot more than just a CPU to be concerned with)
also have more debug hardware
don't really know why cortex-m4 has MPU

AXIM, AHB and APB ARM specific
will have a bus matrix (which allows different peripherals to communicate via master and slave ports by requesting and sending data)
off this, have AHB (higher frequency and higher bandwidth).
like to think of AHB as host bus as it feeds into APBs via a bridge. APB1 normally half frequency of APB2
we can see that DMA can go directly to APB without going through bus matrix
So, relevent for speed and clock concerns going through which bus?
Also to know if we are DMA'ing something and CPUing something, they
are not going to be fighting on the same bus, i.e. spread out load
lower power peripherals on lower frequency busses?
this level of knowledge further emphasises need to know hardware to understand what is going on

astable means no stable states, i.e. is not predominatley low or high, e.g. square wave, sine wave etc.
oscillator generates wave (could be for carrier or clock)

internal mcu oscillators typically RC, so subject to frequency variability

Max out the HCLK in the clock diagram as we are not running off battery.
Will have clock sources, e.g. HSI, HSE, PLL. output of these is SYSCLK.
SYSCLK is what would use to calculate cpu instruction cycles.

a clock is an oscillator with a counter that records number of cycles since being initialised

Crystal generates stable frequency
PLL is type of clock circuit that allows for high frequency, reliable clock generation (setup also affords easy clock duplication and clock manipulation)
So, PLL system could have RC or crystal input
Feeding into it is a reference input (typically a crystal oscillator) which goes into a voltage controlled oscillator to output frequency
The feedback of the output frequency into the initial phase detector can be changed
Adding dividers/pre-scalers into this circuit allows to get programmable voltage.
So, a combination of stable crystal (however generate relatively slow signal, e.g. 100MHz) and high frequency RC oscillators (a type of VCO; voltage controlled oscillator)

openocd -f /usr/share/openocd/scripts/interface/jlink.cfg -f /usr/share/openocd/scripts/target/stm32f4x.cfg
should open a tcp port on 3333 for gdb

The CPU architecture will have an exception (a cpu interrupt) model. Here, reset behaviour will be defined.
the 32 bit arm cortex-m4 has FPU (a application, m for microcontroller, r high performance real time)
TODO(Ryan): avr vs arm vs rsic-v vs x86 vs powerpc vs sparc vs mips
(what motivations brought about these architectures?)
as often harvard archicture (why?)
Von Neumann, RAM (variables, data, stack) + ROM (code/constants) + I/O all on same CPU bus.
Harvard has ICode bus for ROM, and a SystemBus for RAM + I/O. 
This allows operations to occur simultaneously. So, why use Von Neumann?
it is labelled as an evaluation board
different boards use different ICDI (in-circuit debug interfaces) to flash through SWD via usb-b
e.g. texas instruments use stellaris, stm32 ST-link
is fixed point used anymore?
TODO(Ryan): Why is a floating pin also called high impedance?
To avoid power dissipation and unknown state, 
drive with external source, e.g. ground or voltage.

Pull-up/down resistors are to used for unconnected input pins to avoid floating state
So, a pull-down will have the pin (when in an unconnected state) to ground, i.e. 0V when switch is not on

IMPORTANT: Although enabling internal resistors, 
must look at board schematic as external resistors might overrule

Vdd (drain, power supply to chip)
Vcc (collector, subsection of chip, i.e. supply voltage of circuit)
Vss (sink, ground)
Vee (emitter, ground)

the sparsity of linux can make configuration vary
e.g bluez stack -> modify policies

for long range, LoRa or sigfox
essentially tradeoffs between power and data rate
ieee 802.11 group for WLANs (wifi - high data rate), 
802.15 for WPANs; 802.15.1 (bluetooth - le variant - heavily used in audio), 
802.15.4 low data rate (zigbee implements this standard)


unlike windows msdn, linux documentation is mostly source code (not good as if not fast/easy, not used). 
so, essential to have something like ctags and compile from source (sed -e "s/-Werror//g" -i *.make)
source and unit tests are documentation in many linux sources

xor with itself sets to 0

Aardvark adapter essential for automated testing (so, an adapter of sorts should always be used
for automated testing?)
