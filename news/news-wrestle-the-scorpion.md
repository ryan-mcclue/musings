# NEWS - Wrestle the Scorpion

Make-A-Video AI seems promising

Good news first ever drug to slow down cognitive decline of Alzheimer's.
Also drug to slow down ALS.
Perhaps prolonging drugs first step?

DreamFusion 2D-to-3D looks promising

Will future cars will be synced with mobile OSs from Apple or Android?
Already seeing start of this with CCC (Car Connectivity Consortium) pushing smartphone car unlocking

Unfortunately malware spreads through low-hanging CVEs or social engineering

Memory market collapse, i.e. a type of chip market

How nice that Apple's anti-tracking crackdown only applies to third-party apps

With the growth of hardware, really seems that adaptive learning algorithms are going to be used instead of solving the problem explicitly
Perhaps AI solving the most-optimal implemention of an algorithm is more appetising for me

More companies branching into GPUs with AI functionality, e.g. Intel Arc, Acer etc.
Furthermore, more companies branching into VR, e.g. Lenovo, Facebook etc. 

Is a smart ring really any better than a smart watch?

As you would expect, Raptor Lake CPUs faster single thread speed at a lower wattage

Will it be common place for impaired actors like Bruce Willis to sell likeness for deepfakes?
In China, using virtual influencers.

Again, YouTube offers another thorn; restricting 4K access to subscribers

MCUs that support OTA firmware updates will typically have built-in key storage

Although decentralisation sounds good (own cell network etc.), it requires user maintenance which people will pay others to do and we're back to square one in a way

How does Google Tensor G2 chip with various CPU architectures, e.g. Cortex-A78, Cortex-A55, Cortex-X1 work?

OS's designed for wearables, e.g. WearOS for Android. I suppose wearables have become an established device class target?

It really isn't tinfoil hat mentality to be wary of updating unless necessary, e.g. most recent kernel patch affected Intel graphics displays

Floating pod homes in Panama no one asked for. 

In a literal sense Moore's law is dead, however chiplets pose interesting alternatives

Character.ai chatbot creator.
In fact, AI editor/generators for most artforms seems to exist (video runwayml)

The fluidity of OSs continues with new Ubuntu 22.04 replacing PulseAudio with PipeWire, X11 with Wayland.

Having a live session USB is essential to always give root access to filesystem

Can now get Ubuntu Pro for free, which is just extends LTS to 10 years

Fast GUI file searching with fsearch 

Xbox streaming game console. High network speeds seems to make cloud gaming more affordable. 
However, don't like the idea of constant network connectivity and the power of the provider to shut you out.

15th Century greatest appearance of 'geniuses'. Despite access to information, genius declined.
Seems that require proffesional tutors at young age to instill a human social engagement

Thanks to TCC compiler, can compile C in memory and load it, hence using it in some way like a scripting language
However, this can create serious security holes. Could still use in a sandboxed process, e.g. with libseccomp
WASM allows to run a subset of C++/C (and well anything that compiles to webassembly) in browser as a sandbox. Could use with wasmer library
Indeed, with WASM, can compile a native library and use it on the browser like SQLite3

With the steady proliferation of VR gaming, it's a good thing I was not young during this time

DynamicPixelTuning (DPT) promises to make every pixel capable of outputting all colours.
Therefore, get 3 times resolution than having combined rgb pixels

Very helpful ranger preview in conjunction with `rc.conf` and `scope.sh`  

Apple more like a bank with savings account for Apple Card

Interesting new Danish political party with decisions made by AI.
I think AI as a collaborator is promising

Despite new phones offering a plethora of new features, don't assume that they are bug-free, e.g. pixel phone crash detection malfunctioning on roller coaster, not allowing dialling to 000, etc.

Realise you can overclock RAM with Intel XMP (extreme memory profile)

Although you hear new Apple and Microsoft chips, almost certainly ARM under the hood

Intel NUC (next-unit-computing) just marketing term for small form factors

Although largely unecessary now, Nvidia has lite hash rate which impedes peformance in order to get GPUs into hands of gamers

The decline of the lone app, as Microsoft 365 leviathan

I see AR being more useful than VR, e.g. hololens for soldiers

Meta headset will use eye-tracking to position ads

Perhaps an emeritus professor I'm more willing to listen to.

What I used to take as prima facie from news outlets, now no longer

Unfortantely UNSW basketball CC'd not BCC'd 

To no one's surprise, Windows updates nerf ryzen performance

Marketing plug for cloud gaming consoles when in fact standard phones can do the same thing  

With improved network performance, perhaps cheaper to offload calculations to powerful servers (VDI: virtual desktop infrastructure)

NB-IoT (narrowband, i.e. low power). Also have CoAP (constrained application protocol) for embedded devices to access Internet 

Easy to fall prey to the act of not adding anything useful to a product, but simply adding IoT and calling it smart, e.g. smart condom

HDR (high dynamic range) refers to colour spectrum. Implemented in technologies such as Dobly Vision 
Dolby Atmos is a surround sound technology

RCS seems to be better than SMS

Not really decentralisation with cloud, as many services just operated by a handful of large companies (not what DARPA intended!)
Cloud is really just reduced complexity.
It excels when application simple and low traffic (managing a large application in the cloud is just as difficult as on bare metal)
Or, your traffic patterns are unpredictable
Otherwise, paying an unjustified premium
Sold as computing on demand (no complexity) when in reality, just renting computers at a higher premium 
Let your talents to your own machines, rather than Amazon or Google

Will NFC for door locks take hold?

AI for vaccine development sounds promising

Are the petabit speeds of research optical chip really that useful 
if hardware can't process that fast?
Will radio only get us so far?

Probably better to use url-shortener service for sharing links

Perhaps explainpaper.com could break into reading programming papers

More firm on not using Apple, e.g. Apple not allowing other app-stores, taking revenue percentage of adds on apps, etc. 

Bioengineered plants seem promising in say absorbing air pollutants

Amazon continue to kibosh any semblance of non-monolopy now getting into home insurance

Raptor Lake overclock to over 8GHz (however with liquid nitrogen...)

With development of cheaper more powerful hardware, companies introducing more 'gaming' brands 
e.g. Phillips new gaming monitor

Another cautionary tale to not update with Apple update nerfing ANC earphones
