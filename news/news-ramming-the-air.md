AI: What's hard is problem analysis and design. Tending to the corner cases. Managing error conditions. Figuring out exactly what it is we're trying to do.
The toy problems we see AI addressing never seem to include commands to deal with all of the permutations of a problem. That's because expressing all of those possibilities is best done via, well, a programming language. By the time you tell the AI that the UV lamp's power must be modulated due to OSHA requirements, and a hundred or hundred thousand other nitpicking details, you've basically written the program.
When we address an AI in English we're framing a problem using an imprecise form of communication. It's easy to say X which is then interpreted as Y. Or, being human, we leave out a "not" or stumble over an adjective phrase, commanding the tech to create a design that is orthogonal to our intentions.
I do think AI will be a great assistant for us. It will be able to mine OSS and suggest patterns. Maybe replace some routine operations like setting up configuration registers. But pulling code scoured from the net brings its own perils, as there's plenty of crap out there.
Perhaps in the future the technology will progress to the point where an uber-AI can create real, useful (i.e., complex!) software. In the meantime I think we're on the "inflated expectations" portion of the hype cycle.
