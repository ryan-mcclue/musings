Asteriod found with high concentrations of iron and nickel worth $10quintillion 

With false uptimes reported by say Telstra, has become Goodhart's law (when a measure becomes target, fails to be useful)

Generative AI revolution has begun. 
ChatGPT fastest growing user base in history
Important to note that code generation still gets conceptual and implementation details wrong
Best suited for text generation like, cover letter, resume, interview preparation, mission statement etc.
So, chatbots become prevalent; incorporated into word/powerpoint/browser etc. However, will probably incorporate paid-for links in results
However, don't want to fully embrace the idea of talking to an AI as a required 'skill'
In fact, currently could be bad for novices; at the moment, they lack and understanding of the truth, and so are likely to make mistakes with confidence
Furthmore, proofreading code is hard

a follow on from this is how I view open source.
not as the altruistic community participiation, but rather from tit-for-tat as a game theory for making an efficient product
all users add features they want for themselves. the rule is they have to give them back.

Technology to decode EEG brain waves is fairly stable. Possibly present in wearable devices.
Extends on from using machine learning to understand customer

Space force in full reality. Satellite surveillance and weapons

Despite an appliance being smart, most users have them disconnected from the Internet.
With embedded, important to be responsible and not brick device if company shuts down.
Also, if automated, add a manual option

Are their sufficient AI generative models to embody the four horsemen for human made technology?

Growth of companies offloading to independent workers instead of retaining fulltime

Analysing genes in centenarians finds they have a particular gene that protects against cardiovascular events.
Safer to give people protein produced by this gene rather than gene therapy

Often times I'm subject to the Dunning-Kruger effect when it comes to programming

Interesting that most farmers rent patented seeds from large companies

Just like supposed driverless cars being fully functional, Microsofts chat bot is highly error prone.
This is from a company that purports to be the leader in this space, having invested billions

Emulation plentiful. PS2, n64, android, containers etc.
