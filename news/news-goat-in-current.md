EMV (europay, mastercard and visa) secure payment technology embedded in credit card chip

Waited till USB-C becoming standard to introduce reversible USB-A (achieved with movable plastic divider and duplicated pins)
Intel thunderbolt faster than USB-C, yet ports still look very similar

AI in sensors used to alter configuration to optimise power consumption
AI generated voice, text. Disney can now alter age
AI parsing of voice (natural language processing)
In summary, generative AI everywhere. 
In fact, with ChatGPT being able to explain technical concepts, birth of AGI (artificial general intelligence)
Perhaps this could be used as a sort of offline search engine. In fact, ChatGPT generate prompt for DALLE
Whilst ChatGPT solves problems considering computers as generalised machines, it seems eventually it will get there.
So, embedded probably the last the be tackled due to unique systems

Genetic engineering in flora seems more appetising, e.g. drought-resistance wheat, air purifing plants

Batcat tool is cat with syntax highlighting

Skeptical of announcements made by budget-starved laboratories (e.g. universities) about breakthroughs for technologies decades away, e.g. fusion 
There are often caveats and furthermore, commerciality is most likely decades away

Seems that bipartisan government action required to fix rats nest of drivers in modern OSs in a similar vein to EU enforcing anti-competitive laws on Apple to allow third-party apps, USB-C etc.
