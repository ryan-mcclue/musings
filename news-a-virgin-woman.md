Thread is new low-power protocol for Matter (and therefore IoT devices, i.e. mesh network). Similar to Zigbee and Z-Wave

client-server:star

Advent of more software in cars has led to subscription based services, e.g. heated seats.
However, adding software increases complexity:
* Will lack of connectivity (e.g., no cell coverage where you're at) mean that the features are disabled until you get back into cell range?
* Can the servers be DOS'd so that nobody's seat heaters work?
* If I pay for a subscription and sell a car, does the subscription stay with the car? Or will it be like Tesla's approach, where the new owner has to pay to unlock the software features, even if the previous owner paid?
* What if there is a bug on the server that incorrectly reports my subscription status? Will I be refunded, fully or partially?
* What happens when you can't get in touch with customer support because your subscription isn't being properly detected on the hardware?
* What happens if the hardware breaks, but you've paid for the subscription? Is repair to heated seats covered under terms of the subscription, or will that be pushed to owners?
* What happens if this strategy is used by a smaller company than BMW, who suddenly goes out of business and bricks your otherwise perfectly working hardware due to shutting down servers?

Are big-tech companies realising the flaws in their 'Simplicity Sprints' culture? Slowing hiring, realising they have way too many employees

BCI (brain computer interfaces) are a real future

Unfortunate that 'true security' makes things more complex and inconvenient, e.g. yubikey 

Physics head-scratcher: dark matter makes up 80% of universe, yet we can't detect it? 

Meta releasing AI chatbot to wild has again resulted in racist and sexist comments

More evidence of contrasting quality between modern hardware and software with worldwide Google outage caused by software update

Oncall software engineers akin to casual teachers

What are FPGAs and how do they allow the creation of hardware for emulating old games like GBA?
EU enforcing USB-C forces Apple to switch to USB-C. Yay!

Oh dear, Java is not dying out  (state of the octoverse)

Realise I'm highly misanthropic
Frequent STMicroelectronics newsletter coverage of IoT (and the many, many protocols) and machine learning indicative of trend in industry

Hi-fi audio. Newer terms to mean higher fidelity/data resolution 
new OLED TVs. QLED is a variation of the white backlight LED LCD sandwich
5.1 means 5 speakers, 1 subwoofer
woofer, subwoofer, speaker, tweeter

Things getting smaller and more data, e.g. 'normal' sized VR headsets

I really don't see fold phones as necessary...

Are we moving down the road of homogenous, e.g. specifically target CPU or GPU or hetereogenous programming, e.g. CUDA  

Although a update pathway is provided from 20.04 to 22.04, I'm reluctant to do so due to possible configuration issues.
Why I chose LTS 5 year support (2025)

Interesting maglev trains reach amazing speeds and produce minimal noise due to lack of friction

Interesting blood transfusions from older mice to younger mice, the younger mice display characteristics of old mice 

Bitcoin is a Ponzi scheme as almost no one actually uses it in transactions, and is purely speculative.
Does not create anything. Interesting manifestation of capitalism.

Moore's law number of transistors doubles every 2 years. Although not strictly true, general trend is holding. 
Proebsting's law states that compiler improvements will double program performance every 18 years. 
Therefore, cautious about the performance benefits a compiler brings. Focusing on programmer productivity is more fruitful
In general, newer compilers take longer to compile, but produce slightly faster code maybe 20% faster.

Cyberdecks are evidence that the trend of going smaller isn't always aesthetic

Growing trend to have workstations operate in the cloud or containerisation. For testing yes, for development however?

Strive towards much more potent nuclear fusion reactors as oppose to nuclear fission (neutron splits Uranium, same as original nuclear bombs)

Amazing that certain old rpm harddrives were susceptible to crashing when 'Rhythm Nation' played as the resonant frequency was the same

Streaming outnumbering cable and broadcast TV

ripgrep a much faster and user friendly grep!
unar will automatically handle pesky non-folder archives

Interesting to see if mir wayland will take over xlib x11

Although the open nature of RISC-V gives it some economical advantages, historically the ISA
has not been the major driving factor in widespread adoption. Rather, who invests the most in
R&D, e.g. many places will develop ARM, with RISC-V go on your own.  

Security an ever present issue, e.g. every Ubuntu weekly newsletter get a list a security updates

Privacy laws prevent recording keystrokes in app, however can record other information like time between keypresses etc. to identify you, e.g. TikTok

Chiplets connection of chips. So, can build chiplets that aren't SoC, e.g. just CPUs and SoCs without chiplets
Intel R&D into chiplet technology stacking presents it as a future possibility (Apple already uses it with two M1 max chips to M1 ultra)

ACM (Association for Computing Machinery) Turing Award is essentially Nobel Prize for Computer Science.
Not applicable for me as awards largely for academic contributions like papers/reports published e.g data abstraction (Liskov substitution, Byzantine fault tolerance), parallel computing (OpenMP standard).
I'm more concerned with engineering feats in software products. 

An unfortunate reality of open tech, AI being used to make paywalls 'smarter' 

Read a Google research project on removing noise in photos. 
Investigate source to test and am completely put off by the amount of
dependencies involved: conda (why not just whole hog and docker), python, jax for TPU (python to tensor processing unit), external repositories
Docker has uses in CI

AI for everything dogma is becomming more pervasive with 'clusters' to train model.
Although Tesla can build a supercomputer to train, like all dogmas, not applicable to everything (readability, debugging goes down)
