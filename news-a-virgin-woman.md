Thread is new low-power protocol for Matter (and therefore IoT devices, i.e. mesh network). Similar to Zigbee and Z-Wave

Advent of more software in cars has led to subscription based services, e.g. heated seats.
However, adding software increases complexity:
* Will lack of connectivity (e.g., no cell coverage where you're at) mean that the features are disabled until you get back into cell range?
* Can the servers be DOS'd so that nobody's seat heaters work?
* If I pay for a subscription and sell a car, does the subscription stay with the car? Or will it be like Tesla's approach, where the new owner has to pay to unlock the software features, even if the previous owner paid?
* What if there is a bug on the server that incorrectly reports my subscription status? Will I be refunded, fully or partially?
* What happens when you can't get in touch with customer support because your subscription isn't being properly detected on the hardware?
* What happens if the hardware breaks, but you've paid for the subscription? Is repair to heated seats covered under terms of the subscription, or will that be pushed to owners?
* What happens if this strategy is used by a smaller company than BMW, who suddenly goes out of business and bricks your otherwise perfectly working hardware due to shutting down servers?

Are big-tech companies realising the flaws in their 'Simplicity Sprints' culture? Slowing hiring, realising they have way too many employees

BCI (brain computer interfaces) are a real future

Unfortunate that 'true security' makes things more complex and inconvenient, e.g. yubikey 

Physics head-scratcher: dark matter makes up 80% of universe, yet we can't detect it? 

Meta releasing AI chatbot to wild has again resulted in racist and sexist comments

What are FPGAs and how do they allow the creation of hardware for emulating old games like GBA?
EU enforcing USB-C forces Apple to switch to USB-C. Yay!

Oh dear, Java is not dying out  (state of the octoverse)

Realise I'm highly misanthropic
Frequent STMicroelectronics newsletter coverage of IoT (and the many, many protocols) and machine learning indicative of trend in industry

Hi-fi audio. Newer terms to mean higher fidelity/data resolution 
new OLED TVs. QLED is a variation of the white backlight LED LCD sandwich
5.1 means 5 speakers, 1 subwoofer
woofer, subwoofer, speaker, tweeter

Things getting smaller and more data, e.g. 'normal' sized VR headsets

I really don't see fold phones as necessary...

Are we moving down the road of homogenous, e.g. specifically target CPU or GPU or hetereogenous programming, e.g. CUDA  

Although a update pathway is provided from 20.04 to 22.04, I'm reluctant to do so due to possible configuration issues.
Why I chose LTS 5 year support (2025)

Interesting maglev trains reach amazing speeds and produce minimal noise due to lack of friction

Bitcoin is a Ponzi scheme as almost no one actually uses it in transactions, and is purely speculative.
Does not create anything. Interesting manifestation of capitalism.

Moore's law number of transistors doubles every 2 years. Although not strictly true, general trend is holding. 
Proebsting's law states that compiler improvements will double program performance every 18 years. 
Therefore, cautious about the performance benefits a compiler brings. Focusing on programmer productivity is more fruitful
In general, newer compilers take longer to compile, but produce slightly faster code maybe 20% faster.
