Advent of more software in cars has led to subscription based services, e.g. heated seats.
However, adding software increases complexity:
* Will lack of connectivity (e.g., no cell coverage where you're at) mean that the features are disabled until you get back into cell range?
* Can the servers be DOS'd so that nobody's seat heaters work?
* If I pay for a subscription and sell a car, does the subscription stay with the car? Or will it be like Tesla's approach, where the new owner has to pay to unlock the software features, even if the previous owner paid?
* What if there is a bug on the server that incorrectly reports my subscription status? Will I be refunded, fully or partially?
* What happens when you can't get in touch with customer support because your subscription isn't being properly detected on the hardware?
* What happens if the hardware breaks, but you've paid for the subscription? Is repair to heated seats covered under terms of the subscription, or will that be pushed to owners?
* What happens if this strategy is used by a smaller company than BMW, who suddenly goes out of business and bricks your otherwise perfectly working hardware due to shutting down servers?

Are big-tech companies realising the flaws in their 'Simplicity Sprints' culture? Slowing hiring, realising they have way too many employees
