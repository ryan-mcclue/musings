240V/50Hz mains.

oscilloscope default noise is mains (200MHz, 1Gsamples/sec as oppose to multimeter which is maybe 
10samples/sec so really only applicable for perhaps a logic gate or 0.1hz square wave)

Ensure BNC connector is plugged in correctly (affect probe compensation; similar to banana plugs in multimeter not being plugged in correctly)

IMPORTANT: ensure offset dials are correct first, i.e. at 0 so 0 is centre
with menu, end-arrows can still be pressed even if not visible
change to 24mega points for memory when just wanting wave length (not zooming in?)

Continous triggering enables us to view from start point, i.e. static image not free flowing. 
Will show before and after trigger point, i.e. start in centre of screen

single-shot triggering contact bounce first then ringing as stablises 
(makes it a balancing act between selecting triggering level for button press and release)
verify signal ringing (e.g. clock signal), i.e. inspect ramp-up/down (measure time to completely bottom out)

Normal-mode triggering the best of both worlds (will show black screen unless triggered)



No real issue with oscilloscope blowing up if testing battery powered/isolated DC power supply.
With USB powered, ground must be on ground! Otherwise will short USB and that port will probably break

Using RS232 (recommended standard) decoder functionality (there is also SPI/I2C decoding).

Also investigate PWM  


math -> decoder on; event table on (make sure zoomed out enough to view multiple packets (this will increase memory automatically?); increase baud also)

Bus Pirate has PIC as a SOIC (surface outline integrated circuit) package

Multimeter measure power consumption of MCU? (stm32 nucleo boards have convenient IDD jumper)
