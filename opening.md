1. SPEED:
- create models with newest sensors straight away
- create new models all-the-time

2. A BUSINESS IS SOMETHING THAT MAKES MONEY. THIS IS NUMBER 1 PRIORITY NOT MONEY OUT
- MUST KNOW HOW PEOPLE ARE GOING TO PAY YOU, E.G. PAYPAL, STRIPE AND
HOW ARE YOU GOING TO CONVINCE THEM (OFFER THEM A PROMISE, E.G YOU WILL ...)
- don't think about what costs money, e.g. make logo, make website, registered trademark
if no one paying you, not a business
think about what brings money in
- have a website with models, prices and advertising
"sorry because of such high demand, have to wait few extra weeks for product"
"in meantime, here is a free gift"
- money fixes problems, i.e. can go back and fix other problems that cost money later, e.g. getting a registered trademark, getting an office (money in is vanity)
- you don't need fancy things until PEOPLE START PAYING YOU MONEY
- at least if no one buys from advertising, you haven't lost anything

3. START BUSINESSES CHEAPLY. DON'T SPEND ON FULFILLMENT, SPEND MORE ON MONEY IN FIRST
- when you have large amounts of money, can make a lot of mistakes
- allows you to see what is viable without risk
- can have cheap/basic products first then make better later

4. UTILISE FAMILY AND FRIENDS.
- they can work for free at the start.
- younger people more knowledgable of social media, e.g. tiktok

paid ads on facebook, instagram, tiktok 

for supplier, can get faster than aliexpress however cost more

add x3 markup on product

(buying in bulk will get faster shipping times)
manually -> DSers app to automate purchases -> sourcing agent
be upfront with customers regarding shipping time at the start 
(we are just testing, i.e. consistent sales and proof of demand at the start, 
so long shipping times are fine. just mention in FAQ or shipping policy etc.)
(get customisable product later, i.e. branded box as will have to pay in bulk on Alibaba for them to do this)

Handling Returns:
1. damaged: get user to send photo, have them keep the product, get supplier to ship another
2. ok: ask user to pay for shipping costs back to you. then refund them

TikTok film yourself using a product, see if video can go viral (whole skill in itself)

ads spend $50 per day. around $150-$200 to test a product until find a winner

front-loaded time investment. 
once found good product, 30-60min per day of ads (ads manager, metrics, etc.)
2-3 hours a day overall
spend daily time on product research (DEVELOP SKILLS TO FIND A PRODUCT THAT IS WANTED AS A GOOD PRODUCT IS KEY), 
copyrighting, competitors, etc.

niche store

targeting impulse buyers, not value shoppers.
show innovative product with wow factor, they buy on the spot

BRANDING:

high perceived value
can it not be bought in stores
targeted to customer niche
