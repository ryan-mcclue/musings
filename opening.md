1. SPEED:
- create models with newest sensors straight away
- create new models all-the-time

2. A BUSINESS IS SOMETHING THAT MAKES MONEY. THIS IS NUMBER 1 PRIORITY NOT MONEY OUT
- MUST KNOW HOW PEOPLE ARE GOING TO PAY YOU, E.G. PAYPAL, STRIPE AND
HOW ARE YOU GOING TO CONVINCE THEM (OFFER THEM A PROMISE, E.G YOU WILL ...)
- don't think about what costs money, e.g. make logo, make website, registered trademark
if no one paying you, not a business
think about what brings money in
- have a website with models, prices and advertising
"sorry because of such high demand, have to wait few extra weeks for product"
"in meantime, here is a free gift"
- money fixes problems, i.e. can go back and fix other problems that cost money later, e.g. getting a registered trademark, getting an office (money in is vanity)
- you don't need fancy things until PEOPLE START PAYING YOU MONEY
- at least if no one buys from advertising, you haven't lost anything

3. START BUSINESSES CHEAPLY. DON'T SPEND ON FULFILLMENT, SPEND MORE ON MONEY IN FIRST
- when you have large amounts of money, can make a lot of mistakes
- allows you to see what is viable without risk
- can have cheap/basic products first then make better later

4. UTILISE FAMILY AND FRIENDS.
- they can work for free at the start.
- younger people more knowledgable of social media, e.g. tiktok

5. COMMAND PRESENTATIONAL RESPECT

6. SELL TO EXISTING CUSTOMERS
- add-on product
- email all customers on database with a discounted offer

7. WORRY ABOUT LEGAL WHEN RICH
- all we need is a domain and a website

## E-COMMERCE
brand concept and website essentials

find products from amazon, etsy, ebay, etc.
however, only sell with aliexpress as offers dropshipping methods, i.e. no packaging
alibaba is wholesale not dropshipping, i.e. must buy in bulk

paid ads on facebook, instagram, tiktok 

for supplier, can get faster than aliexpress however cost more

add x3 markup on product

(buying in bulk will get faster shipping times)
manually -> DSers app to automate purchases -> sourcing agent
be upfront with customers regarding shipping time at the start 
(we are just testing, i.e. consistent sales and proof of demand at the start, 
so long shipping times are fine. just mention in FAQ or shipping policy etc.)
(get customisable product later, i.e. branded box as will have to pay in bulk on Alibaba for them to do this)

Handling Returns:
1. damaged: get user to send photo, have them keep the product, get supplier to ship another
2. ok: ask user to pay for shipping costs back to you. then refund them

TikTok film yourself using a product, see if video can go viral (whole skill in itself)

ads spend $50 per day. around $150-$200 to test a product until find a winner

front-loaded time investment. 
once found good product, 30-60min per day of ads (ads manager, metrics, etc.)
2-3 hours a day overall
spend daily time on product research 
(DEVELOP SKILLS TO FIND A PRODUCT THAT IS WANTED AS A GOOD PRODUCT IS KEY), 
copyrighting, competitors, etc.

niche store

targeting impulse buyers, not value shoppers (so, sell under $100)
show innovative product with wow factor, they buy on the spot

if product out of stock, refund and send them a 10% discount code

### BRANDING:
get product that solves problem or adds value to their life in a meaningful way
high perceived value
can it not be bought in stores
targeted to customer niche
lightweight and easy to ship
possible to add markup
pick something that you have expertise in, allowing for easier market research
- health (back pain, sun-burn); pet supplies
needs to have WOW/UNIQUE-factor to GRAB ATTENTION IN AD

Have 5-10 products on website to build trust.
Only put ads in for one HERO PRODUCT at a time

DAILY RESEARCH TO SELECT PRODUCTS:
TIME CONSUMING PROCESS TO UNDERSTAND MARKET
REGULAR ACTIVITY, NO OFF SWITCH
- manual (see what products are selling well on websites); Google Trends to verify search volume for product
- social media ads (follow big theme instagram pages, initiate checkout to get ad algorithm to follow)
- (START WITH THIS: spy tools (combine previous 2))
- IMPORTANT: The only way to know if will work is to test with your own ads. These are just indicators
- identify how much competitor selling for by reverse searching image 
As gain experience, will see products over and over again, 
i.e. product saturation (Google Trends can show this)

### STORE CREATION
Make website fit your brand before adding ads

Make sure domain is available before setting site name (short word namelix.com) 
Also ensure domain is verified and web events prioritised before ads?

Tracking essential before running ads, so as to better optimise ads
Facebook/tiktok pixels tracking code on website installable through shopify app
Google analytics as well

(Zoho) info@storename.com

Shopify payments (credit cards) and paypal (business account)

Shopify apps:
* Fulfillment app:
  DSers -> aliexpress
  (CJDropshipping, S-pocket, weho, zendrop all have there own apps)
* Aftership (helps customers track order)
* Klaviyo/SMSBump marketing channels (email/text, e.g. abandoned cart emails etc.) 
* Vitals (Product Reviews, Volume Discounts/Product Bundles (Upsells), 
  Currency Converter, Visitor Replays, Wheel of Fortune, Frequently Bought Together, 
  Related Products and Product Description tabs.)
(want to save purchase information to allow one-click purchasing if returning to increase LTV)
(offer discount in post-purchase emails)
(GO INTO SHOPIFY AND MODIFY CONFIRMATION EMAIL TO INCLUDE 24HR DISCOUNT
CONFIRMATION EMAILS HAVE 100% OPEN-RATE)

Put shipping times at bottom of product page, shipping policies and FAQs

Essential pages:
Home Page, About Us, Product Pages, FAQs, Legal Policies and Contact Us
add a Shipping Policy and Track Your Order page via the Aftership app

Conversion rate optimisation (if not getting sales, one of these needs improving):
* Product Photos (5-10 photos; flat-lays on whitebackground and lifestyle someone using)
initially source from Aliexpress, alibaba, amazon 
(later down the track can: take photos yourself, 3D realistic model from fiverr/upwork, get professional photos etc.)
* Pricing (Compare at Price on Shopify for discount offering?)
(Test free shipping. Perhaps best to offer free shipping over $X to increase AOV)
* Product Description
Hero lines describing one core benefit (i.e. how improve's life)
then 5 bullet-points describing more features (i.e. what the product does)
MAKE SURE BENEFIT IS TANGIBLE/SPECIFIC AND METRIC BASED IF POSSIBLE, E.G 1000 songs in pocket
can look at real reviews and write description on their pain points
* Product Reviews (import reviews from Aliexpress via Vitals app and ensure grammar is correct and have both good and bad reviews) 
(hero product should have the most)
* Website Speed (jpgs over pngs (crushpics app), no videos, low number of apps)

Make sure have a 30day money-back garuntee. Ensure customers can contact easily

Anything over 3% good conversion rate

landing page are more suited for digital products (and take a lot longer to make) 
(can later do with say Shogun, zipify pages etc.)

### MARKETING
Human beings are biologically programmed with 8 main desires: 
Survival, food/drink, freedom from danger, sex, comfortable living conditions, 
being superior to others, 
protection of loved ones and social approval.
Ads that target these will be subconsciously watched

paid traffic and organic traffic (TikTok with someone using your product. study and recreate competitor videos)
AT LEAST $50 A DAY ON ADS. $150-$200 TO TEST A PRODUCT (does not include $50 for ad creative)
run ads for 4-7 days to test (if perform terribly on day 1, then probably kill earlier)
(have to give time for ad algorithm to optimise to find your buyers)
should get sales within 1-3 days
after this 4-7 day period, choose to scale up or kill of ad-sets

Facebook (includes Instagram) and TikTok (perhaps if targeting younger audience)
Start with one platform, Facebook (king for ecommerce due to data collection and targeted ads)
With Facebook, set feedback score to send after 8 weeks to ensure to not being blocked if too many bad reviews

Need to have video ads first?
Hire ad creatives on Fiverr #resources section

Ad Metrics:
INTEREST:
* Link CPC (cost per click) how much it costs for one person to click on your ad?
* Link CTR how many people click through to see website after ad
ULTIMATE METRIC (if this profitable after 4-7 days, scale product):
* Cost per purchase how much it costs for someone to purchase on website?
