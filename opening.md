1. SPEED:
- create models with newest sensors straight away
- create new models all-the-time

2. A BUSINESS IS SOMETHING THAT MAKES MONEY. THIS IS NUMBER 1 PRIORITY NOT MONEY OUT
- MUST KNOW HOW PEOPLE ARE GOING TO PAY YOU, E.G. PAYPAL, STRIPE AND
HOW ARE YOU GOING TO CONVINCE THEM (OFFER THEM A PROMISE, E.G YOU WILL ...)
- don't think about what costs money, e.g. make logo, make website, registered trademark
if no one paying you, not a business
think about what brings money in
- have a website with models, prices and advertising
"sorry because of such high demand, have to wait few extra weeks for product"
"in meantime, here is a free gift"
- money fixes problems, i.e. can go back and fix other problems that cost money later, e.g. getting a registered trademark, getting an office (money in is vanity)
- you don't need fancy things until PEOPLE START PAYING YOU MONEY
- at least if no one buys from advertising, you haven't lost anything

3. START BUSINESSES CHEAPLY. DON'T SPEND ON FULFILLMENT, SPEND MORE ON MONEY IN FIRST
- when you have large amounts of money, can make a lot of mistakes
- allows you to see what is viable without risk
- can have cheap/basic products first then make better later

4. UTILISE FAMILY AND FRIENDS.
- they can work for free at the start.
- younger people more knowledgable of social media, e.g. tiktok
