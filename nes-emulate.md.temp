Before cpus increased in single thread execution speed. Now more cores. It's a topic of research to convert single threaded into multithreaded for emulation. 
This is why emulation of something like the GameCube (powerpc) is slow. 
Furthermore, due to hardware irregularities that programs relied on may take hundreds of instructions to emulate
If actually a simple translation, then should run close to native speed. This is reality of emulating hardware with hardware
