Understand particular images and what is associated with it, e.g. ancient egyptian fresco use most common images for part of body, e.g a foot is more easily recognisable side-on

To draw something like a frog, identify its typical characteristics, e.g. big eyes, colour green, long legs
By drawing these, we convey a frog.
So, can draw something by doing less.
However, this simplification can only be performed once a detailed analysis of the subject has been performed.

A good drawing is one that does not arouse any misunderstanding. Like being a good singer, just having a high vocal range doesn't make you good. Or an actor that can cry on command

Perhaps the idea of conveying a distinct idea is what differentiates art from illustration?
