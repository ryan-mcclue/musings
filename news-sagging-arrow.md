# NEWS - Sagging Arrow
I believe decoding brain waves into functional output is major change in my future

Unikernel has applications bundled inside kernel (so like eBPF) for high performance

Amusing Dead Internet Theory that the Internet died around 2016 and is now largely bots

Oh dear, javascript smart watch

Interesting 3D print to make diffusing sheet for say LEDs to create different ambiences

AI now being used to improve compression algorithms

Amazing potential of 'molecular computers' to make drugs with precise traits
(could extend to human's gaining amazing a priori skills)

JPEG XL better compression and lossy + lossless mode

Again, Microsoft updates not working. This time, not actually properly applying vulnerability update

Interesting can just buy off the shelf drone and attach something like an ESP32 to send data back to us

Cool program that sort of gamifies video conferencing allowing for individual chats: gather.town 

Like 'Scrum Certification' now with Matter have an official certification process

Good work being done in legislating IoT labels, e.g. like nutrition labels that give information sensor data collected by device 

Have GPU microarchitectures like RNDA.

Chiplets seem future of shrinking size and expanding computing power, now seen in GPUs

VSR (virtual super technology) has GPU scale to 4K and then downscale if necessary to monitor's resolution
However, if want say 8K gaming, will require a DisplayPort cable

Robots beginning to see more everyday use, e.g. waiters.
Also, have robots learn in the field, e.g. Texas University have robots walking around campus 

Resistive RAM uses analog memory cells to store more information with less energy

GPT-4 upcoming text generation AI
Perhaps text-to-speech, language transcription too diverse to solve without AI, e.g. deepgram program

Although some people experience myocarditis after COVID vaccine, myocarditis long been linked to a number of viral infections

Borg like spacecraft, i.e. cubesat now in orbit

Silicon carbide power supplies more efficient

AI requires high quality data, i.e. created by skilled individuals.
Also requires unique data. Might not have enough unique data in the future

Unfortunate that Intel releasing software-defined-silicon, i.e. pay-as-you-go to enable certain hardware features

Not even subtle that ads are no longer targeted for you, but rather shills 

Prompt engineers for many AI generators, e.g. text-davinci-3 

GPU AI DLSS improve performance by offloading frame generation 

Biodegradable sensors made out of organic circuitry proof of concept

Watching me sleep on the floor is watching how the sausage is made in regards to my posture

Serendipitously obtain a bokeh photo with my outdated phone camera
