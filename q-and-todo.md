* cool idea of SDR (software defined radio) and RF analyser
https://greatscottgadgets.com/sdr/1/
https://github.com/ainfosec/FISSURE

* if COMP3331 largely theoretical.
apply to calculating speed differences for our Internet connection,
e.g. WiFi vs Ethernet. DSL vs FTTN vs FTTP.
when does it reach trans-alantic-cable.
wherein the packet flow is the largest bottleneck? 
is it just geographic distance from Australia?

* how does quantum computing work?

* what frequencies/technologies are regulated like in ISM; by extension
what other regulations are there?

* why floating point inaccuracies

* examples of hardware virtualisation instructions/codecs? (e.g. multiway MMU?)

* vulkan renderer:

* how does something like red hat and android get around gplv2 of linux kernel

* the SIG introduces bluetooth 5 which states higher data rate, long range BLE etc.
are their decisions informed on techonology advances (seems not to be the case with 4G LTE...)

* Understand memory alignment and cost of unaligned accesses? 
(is it due to common programmer workflows and less transistors required?)
for modern hardware, trying to read data from an unaligned memory access
can result in 2 reads and a combine
so, there are custom compiler options to specify alignment (declspec() for stack, aligned_malloc for heap)
why not just always automatically align things? conserve space?
when to use these alignment extensions? when doing performance timing/tuning?

* is distinction between a unicast (device to device), multicast (device to some devices), broadcast (device to all devices)
only discernable in packet format, i.e. must be parsed by network card first?
are signal strength changed?

* Software laws,  e. G.  Have 4k in name,  but image quality 1080p, Elon musk making false claims, 
Most dash cams same SoC,  and image sensor,  just different housing 
Garmon products to use must sign up for garmin account and agree to collection of data
what are laws for misinformation, e.g. tesla, '4k' dash cams, stats misleading: M1 chip faster (only faster than Intel based macs),
we don't track in 'traditional' ways, tiktok keylogger technology exists but not using

security so vast and not something I want to devote time to:

the constellation we can't see as it's blocked by the sign is the zodiac sign for that month
not new territory to regain interest in the past, e.g. renaissance grew interest in ancient greek astrology
zodiac latinized of zodiakos, meaning circle of animals (all zodiac names latinized greek)
vernal is beginning of astronomical year; daylight starts getting longer until summer solstice.
hence, spring is when zodiac starts
aries (march 20th) -> ram
taurus (april) -> bull
gemini (may) -> twin brothers
cancer (june) -> crab
leo (july) -> lion
virgo (august) -> woman
libra (september) -> scales of justice
scorpio (october) -> scorpion
sagittarius (november) -> archer's arrow
capricorn (december) -> goat 
aquarius (january) -> water bearer
pisces (feburary) -> opposing fish

IS IT POSSIBLE THAT AN ASSEMBLY INSTRUCTION LIKE RDTSCP COULD BE TRAPPED BY PROGRAM LOADER?

NOTE(importance of reading programming papers.... after handmade finished)

vector math routines (obtaining cross product from column vector form)
when drawing vectors in a physical sense, 
keep in mind they are rooted at the origin (even if drawings show them across time)
whenever doing vector addition/subtraction, remember the head-to-tail rule (their direction is determined by their sign).
could also think that subtract whenever you want to 'go away' from something
dot product transpose notation useful for emulating matrix multiplication
unit circle, x = cosθ
dot product allows us to project a vector's length onto a unit vector 
dot product allows us to measure a vector on any axis system we want by setting up two unit vectors that are orthogonal to each other
simple plane equation with d=0 will be through origin (altering d shifts the plane up/down)
cross product gives vector that is orthogonal to the plane that the two original vectors lie on (length is |a|·|b|·sinθ). So, really only works in at least 3 dimensions
with units, e.g. for camera, start with arbitrary 'unit' defintion. later move onto more physical things like metres
by applying a scaling factor to direction vector, can move along it
world space coordinates. camera position is based on these. the camera will have its own axis system which we determine what it should be and then use cross product based on what we want
understanding dot product equivalence with circle equation
for multiplication of vectors, be explicit with a hadamard function
(IMPORTANT have reciprocal square root approximation which is there specifically for normalisation. 
much faster cycle count and latency than square root)

noise is randomness. white noise is complete randomness. blue noise (harder to generate) is randomness with limitations on how close together points can be (more uniform)
