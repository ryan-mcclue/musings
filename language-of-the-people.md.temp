# Language of the People

Garbage collection replaces us with a 'search' of our memory and decides when to free
So really only use if you can't figure out when to free something
This search is not free

No language implements a feature that determines a memory footprint, i.e. how much memory we use

Know OS specific forking (process launching), file checking/reading/writing, IPCs

Steps for adding new feature: 
create a new file, e.g. commands.c and include it in main.c (order it before things that will use it) 
then do a git commit.
This gets us off on a nice feeling
In new file, create function with barebones functionality that can then be inserted into location and called/tested

Simple word parser use `at[1] != '\0' && at[1] == 'a'`

Simple single line parser:
First separate by whitespace with `while (at[0] != '\0'); break` and `eat_spaces(), find_ch_from_left()`
