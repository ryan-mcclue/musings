QUESTIONS:
Shipping on linux is very time consuming and not worth it monetarily?
Linux desktop suffers from binary compatibility nightmare, e.g. 15 binaries to support all. 
This is because libraries like glibc are happy to break abi to get minor improvements, e.g spec says this so let's do it even though no one cares

why writing by words faster?

Do the STL of other languages suffer the same issues as in C?


security so vast and not something I want to devote time to:

the constellation we can't see as it's blocked by the sign is the zodiac sign for that month
not new territory to regain interest in the past, e.g. renaissance grew interest in ancient greek astrology
zodiac latinized of zodiakos, meaning circle of animals (all zodiac names latinized greek)
vernal is beginning of astronomical year; daylight starts getting longer until summer solstice.
hence, spring is when zodiac starts
aries (march 20th) -> ram
taurus (april) -> bull
gemini (may) -> twin brothers
cancer (june) -> crab
leo (july) -> lion
virgo (august) -> woman
libra (september) -> scales of justice
scorpio (october) -> scorpion
sagittarius (november) -> archer's arrow
capricorn (december) -> goat 
aquarius (january) -> water bearer
pisces (feburary) -> opposing fish

IS IT POSSIBLE THAT AN ASSEMBLY INSTRUCTION LIKE RDTSCP COULD BE TRAPPED BY PROGRAM LOADER?

With an undeclared identifier in a unity build, just reorder #includes in main file

vector math routines (obtaining cross product from column vector form)
when drawing vectors in a physical sense, 
keep in mind they are rooted at the origin (even if drawings show them across time)
whenever doing vector addition/subtraction, remember the head-to-tail rule (their direction is determined by their sign).
could also think that subtract whenever you want to 'go away' from something
dot product transpose notation useful for emulating matrix multiplication
unit circle, x = cosθ
dot product allows us to project a vector's length onto a unit vector 
dot product allows us to measure a vector on any axis system we want by setting up two unit vectors that are orthogonal to each other
simple plane equation with d=0 will be through origin (altering d shifts the plane up/down)
cross product gives vector that is orthogonal to the plane that the two original vectors lie on (length is |a|·|b|·sinθ). So, really only works in at least 3 dimensions
with units, e.g. for camera, start with arbitrary 'unit' defintion. later move onto more physical things like metres
by applying a scaling factor to direction vector, can move along it
world space coordinates. camera position is based on these. the camera will have its own axis system which we determine what it should be and then use cross product based on what we want
understanding dot product equivalence with circle equation
for multiplication of vectors, be explicit with a hadamard function
(IMPORTANT have reciprocal square root approximation which is there specifically for normalisation. 
much faster cycle count and latency than square root)

noise is randomness. white noise is complete randomness. blue noise (harder to generate) is randomness with limitations on how close together points can be (more uniform)
