how does quantum computing work?

Before cpus increased in single thread execution speed. Now more cores. It's a topic of research to convert single threaded into multithreaded for emulation. 
This is why emulation of something like the GameCube (powerpc) is slow. 
Furthermore, due to hardware irregularities that programs relied on may take hundreds of instructions to emulate
If actually a simple translation, then should run close to native speed. This is reality of emulating hardware with hardware


creative commons is a set of licenses that make explicit requirements for users, e.g. CC BY-NC, CC BY-SA, etc.
unlike MIT, Apache includes a user non-litigation, so users can't initiate litigation if the creators decide to patent something

240V/50Hz mains.
oscilloscope default noise is mains (200MHz, 1Gsamples/sec as oppose to multimeter which is maybe 10samples/sec so really only applicable for perhaps a logic gate or 0.1hz square wave)
can debug PWM, I2C
Ensure BNC connector is plugged in correctly (affect probe compensation; similar to banana plugs in multimeter not being plugged in correctly)
Continous triggering enables us to view from start point, i.e. static image not free flowing. Will show before and after trigger point, i.e. start in centre of screen
No real issue with oscilloscope blowing up if testing battery powered/isolated DC power supply.
With USB powered, ground must be on ground! Otherwise will short USB and that port will probably break

Normal-mode triggering the best of both worlds

Using RS232 decoder functionality (there is also SPI/I2C decoding).

Also investigate PWM  

IMPORTANT: ensure offset dials are correct first, i.e. at 0 so 0 is centre
with menu, end-arrows can still be pressed even if not visible
change to 24mega points for memory when just wanting wave length (not zooming in?)

math -> decoder on; event table on (make sure zoomed out enough to view multiple packets (this will increase memory automatically?); increase baud also)

single-shot triggering contact bounce first then ringing as stablises (makes it a balancing act between selecting triggering level for button press and release)

Multimeter measure power consumption of MCU? (stm32 nucleo boards have convenient IDD jumper)

verify signal ringing (e.g. clock signal), i.e. inspect ramp-up/down (measure time to completely bottom out)

As well as headers, just insert hook onto a male-male wire

algorithm interview questions important not to belittle question

QUESTIONS:
Understand memory alignment and cost of unaligned accesses? (is it due to common programmer workflows and less transistors required?)

Understand cycle hits for accessing harddrive?
Are cache cycle timings cumulative?

May compile for different architectures in embedded for different product lines e.g. low-end fit bit, high-end fitbit

Compile with different compilers to see performance benefits at end.
Also possible may have to use a particular compiler for specific hardware.

In reality, don't want an RTOS if timing very critical.
Most MCU don't even have multiple cores so adding software overhead (or are there additional hardware to emulate cores?)
Even without RTOS, will most likely have some timer and separation of tasks.
Main overall benefit of RTOS is consistent driver interfaces across multiple mcus (useful for say complex bluetooth/ethernet stacks etc.)
Most mcus are overpowered for what they do, so using an RTOS is probably a good idea.


tamper response usually done with a button on the board that gets activated when case opens
this will trigger an interrupt handled by RTC (real time clock)

cpu has modes like Stop mode that is a power saving mode.


Linux issues: 1. runtime configurability (difficult part not API, but what to do when settings aren't exact, i.e. what to fall back on when abstraction not there). 2. multiple binaries
Although possible to dynamically load core libraries like xlib/wayland/alsa and support
a minimum set of APIs, this is essentially what SDL does.
However, system/user configurability is huge in linux. There is simply too much
runtime variability to test for all users.
Furthermore, multiple CRT to support, e.g. muslc for Alpine

One way to solve variability is to use the Steam Runtime, which is a collection of .so files and configuration that is less subject to user configuration

Linux desktop suffers from binary compatibility nightmare, e.g. 15 binaries to support all. 
This is because libraries like glibc are happy to break abi to get minor improvements, e.g spec says this so let's do it even though no one cares

C STL has one version for each compiler + os. 
also, some compilers might not fully implement the STL feature

security so vast and not something I want to devote time to:

the constellation we can't see as it's blocked by the sign is the zodiac sign for that month
not new territory to regain interest in the past, e.g. renaissance grew interest in ancient greek astrology
zodiac latinized of zodiakos, meaning circle of animals (all zodiac names latinized greek)
vernal is beginning of astronomical year; daylight starts getting longer until summer solstice.
hence, spring is when zodiac starts
aries (march 20th) -> ram
taurus (april) -> bull
gemini (may) -> twin brothers
cancer (june) -> crab
leo (july) -> lion
virgo (august) -> woman
libra (september) -> scales of justice
scorpio (october) -> scorpion
sagittarius (november) -> archer's arrow
capricorn (december) -> goat 
aquarius (january) -> water bearer
pisces (feburary) -> opposing fish

IS IT POSSIBLE THAT AN ASSEMBLY INSTRUCTION LIKE RDTSCP COULD BE TRAPPED BY PROGRAM LOADER?

With an undeclared identifier in a unity build, just reorder #includes in main file

vector math routines (obtaining cross product from column vector form)
when drawing vectors in a physical sense, 
keep in mind they are rooted at the origin (even if drawings show them across time)
whenever doing vector addition/subtraction, remember the head-to-tail rule (their direction is determined by their sign).
could also think that subtract whenever you want to 'go away' from something
dot product transpose notation useful for emulating matrix multiplication
unit circle, x = cosθ
dot product allows us to project a vector's length onto a unit vector 
dot product allows us to measure a vector on any axis system we want by setting up two unit vectors that are orthogonal to each other
simple plane equation with d=0 will be through origin (altering d shifts the plane up/down)
cross product gives vector that is orthogonal to the plane that the two original vectors lie on (length is |a|·|b|·sinθ). So, really only works in at least 3 dimensions
with units, e.g. for camera, start with arbitrary 'unit' defintion. later move onto more physical things like metres
by applying a scaling factor to direction vector, can move along it
world space coordinates. camera position is based on these. the camera will have its own axis system which we determine what it should be and then use cross product based on what we want
understanding dot product equivalence with circle equation
for multiplication of vectors, be explicit with a hadamard function
(IMPORTANT have reciprocal square root approximation which is there specifically for normalisation. 
much faster cycle count and latency than square root)

noise is randomness. white noise is complete randomness. blue noise (harder to generate) is randomness with limitations on how close together points can be (more uniform)
