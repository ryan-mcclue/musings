memory align up:
sbrk((x + 7) & ~7); sbrk() is system call malloc uses?


1. **Documentation**
   Generalities such as *Debug Interface* or *Procedure Call Standard*
   Architecture specifics such as *armv7m*
   Micro-architecture specifics such as *cortex-m4*
   Micro-controller specifics such as *stm32f429zi*
   Board specifics such as pin-out diagram and schematic
2. **BSP**
   This can be done via an IDE such as STM32CubeMX to create an example project Makefile.
   Alternatively can be done via a command line application such as libopencm3.
3. **Targets**
   Disable hardware fpu instructions and enable libgloss for simulator. Ensure main() call ordering mock test working 
   Enable nano libc with no system calls for target
4. **Flashing and Debugging**
   Coordinate *JLink/STLink* probe and board pin-outs
   Ascertain board debug firmware and determine if reflashing required, e.g. *STLinkReflash*
   Preferable to use debugger software such as *Ozone* that automates flashing.
   If not, determine flash software such as *JLinkExe*, *stlink-tools*, *openocd*, *nrfjprog* etc.
   Coordinate debugger software such as *QTCreator* with qemu gdb server
5. **Hardware Tools**
   Measure voltage, current, resistance/continuity/diode with multimeter?
   Oscilloscope for ...
   Logic analyser for, SPI and I2C

6. **Protocol**
  USB port probably in-built serial port

openocd -f /usr/share/openocd/scripts/interface/jlink.cfg -f /usr/share/openocd/scripts/target/stm32f4x.cfg
should open a tcp port on 3333 for gdb

Seems that an RTOS is a multiprocessing kernel that allows the user to control its scheduling priority?

The CPU architecture will have an exception (a cpu interrupt) model. Here, reset behaviour will be defined.
the 32 bit arm cortex-m4 has FPU (a application, m for microcontroller, r high performance real time)
TODO(Ryan): avr vs arm vs rsic-v vs x86 vs powerpc vs sparc vs mips
(what motivations brought about these architectures?)
as often harvard archicture (why?)
Von Neumann, RAM (variables, data, stack) + ROM (code/constants) + I/O all on same CPU bus.
Harvard has ICode bus for ROM, and a SystemBus for RAM + I/O. 
This allows operations to occur simultaneously. So, why use Von Neumann?
it is labelled as an evaluation board
different boards use different ICDI (in-circuit debug interfaces) to flash through SWD via usb-b
e.g. texas instruments use stellaris, stm32 ST-link
is fixed point used anymore?
TODO(Ryan): Why is a floating pin also called high impedance?
To avoid power dissipation and unknown state, 
drive with external source, e.g. ground or voltage.
Pull-up resistor connected to voltage, pull-down to ground.

the sparsity of linux can make configuration vary
e.g bluez stack -> modify policies

for long range, LoRa or sigfox
essentially tradeoffs between power and data rate
ieee 802.11 group for WLANs (wifi - high data rate), 
802.15 for WPANs; 802.15.1 (bluetooth - le variant - heavily used in audio), 
802.15.4 low data rate (zigbee implements this standard)


unlike windows msdn, linux documentation is mostly source code (not good as if not fast/easy, not used). 
so, essential to have something like ctags and compile from source (sed -e "s/-Werror//g" -i *.make)
source and unit tests are documentation in many linux sources

xor with itself sets to 0

unit test notes from udemy

Aardvark adapter essential for automated testing (so, an adapter of sorts should always be used
for automated testing?)
Ask philip johnston on embedded artistry regarding widespread testing, e.g. multiple adapters?
