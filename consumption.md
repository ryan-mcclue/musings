## Blue Mountains
Blue mountains bordered by the Nepean river to the east, Coxs to the south and Wolgan to the north.
The Nepean river rises around Mittagong and merges with the Hawkesbury at Agnes Banks.
The Coxs river merges with Lake Burragorang
The original great western railway through the Blue Mountains utilised zig-zagging tracks at Lapstone and Lithgow.
This was to avoid cost of building tunnels.
As Blue Mountains elevated, air pressure less, so less dense, so less energy and ability to absorb solar radiation.

Human body mainly oxygen, carbon (stable bonding for organic life), hydrogen and nitrogen (amino acids)
We get our nitrogen from animals or plants. Low nitrogen, low crop yields.
Resowing removes nitrogen from soil, so originally used guano (bird poo)
Haber process creates ammonia from atmosphere rich in nitrogen (though strongly connected via triple bond)
So, Haber process responsible for sustaining such large populations through ammonium nitrate fertiliser
However, ammonium nitrate is also an explosive

## Quantum
RSA public key is two primes multiplied together. 
These primes constitute private key.
Qubit can be in multiple states. So, compute all bit combinations at once.
However, result is a superposition, so can only read one of the state results
Therefore, as difficult to extract meaningful information from superposition, quantum computing not useful for most algorithms 
However, quantum fourier transform can be done on a periodic superposition
So, if superposition has inherent periodicity, useful

## Cosmic Rays
single event upset; soft-error;
trace elements of uranium releasing alpha particles that interfered with transistor in ram (electronics so small)
cosmic rays can cause bit flips all the time, e.g. belgium voting, speed running, plane system
in fact, laboratories have neutron detectors for this
so, could have duplicate computers to account for this, say on an airplane

## Science Media
press-releases for science are oversimplified and sensationalised to attract attention
also pressure to publish first
e.g. worm hole created in quatum computer, really just mathematical simulation
quite often early reports are wrong, e.g. ambient pressure, room-temperature superconductor
some areas in computer science over-hyped, e.g. AI, quantum computing
there can infinite falsities, but only one truth, so most likely wrong

## Lightbulb vacuum triodes
0 kelvin is absence of thermal energy. 247 kelvin is 0celsius
thermionic emission is emission of electrons from a heated surface
this led to vacuum diode, which could rectify AC
signal amplification is increasing amplitude, so further distances and less noise
vacuum diode was first electrical switch used in first digital computer ENIAC

## Jumping Robot
Rubber can store tremendous amounts of elastic energy (also why used for tires as can be deformed)
Carbon fibre high strength-to-weight ratio (graphene best)
