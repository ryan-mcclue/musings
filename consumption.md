## Blue Mountains
Blue mountains bordered by the Nepean river to the east, Coxs to the south and Wolgan to the north.
The Nepean river rises around Mittagong and merges with the Hawkesbury at Agnes Banks.
The Coxs river merges with Lake Burragorang
The original great western railway through the Blue Mountains utilised zig-zagging tracks at Lapstone and Lithgow.
This was to avoid cost of building tunnels.
As Blue Mountains elevated, air pressure less, so less dense, so less energy and ability to absorb solar radiation.

Human body mainly oxygen, carbon (stable bonding for organic life), hydrogen and nitrogen (amino acids)
We get our nitrogen from animals or plants. Low nitrogen, low crop yields.
Resowing removes nitrogen from soil, so originally used guano (bird poo)
Haber process creates ammonia from atmosphere rich in nitrogen (though strongly connected via triple bond)
So, Haber process responsible for sustaining such large populations through ammonium nitrate fertiliser
However, ammonium nitrate is also an explosive

## Quantum
RSA public key is two primes multiplied together. 
These primes constitute private key.
Qubit can be in multiple states. So, compute all bit combinations at once.
However, result is a superposition, so can only read one of the state results
Therefore, as difficult to extract meaningful information from superposition, quantum computing not useful for most algorithms 
However, quantum fourier transform can be done on a periodic superposition
So, if superposition has inherent periodicity, useful

## Cosmic Rays
single event upset; soft-error;
trace elements of uranium releasing alpha particles that interfered with transistor in ram (electronics so small)
cosmic rays can cause bit flips all the time, e.g. belgium voting, speed running, plane system
in fact, laboratories have neutron detectors for this
so, could have duplicate computers to account for this, say on an airplane

## Science Media
press-releases for science are oversimplified and sensationalised to attract attention
also pressure to publish first
e.g. worm hole created in quatum computer, really just mathematical simulation
quite often early reports are wrong, e.g. ambient pressure, room-temperature superconductor
some areas in computer science over-hyped, e.g. AI, quantum computing
there can infinite falsities, but only one truth, so most likely wrong

## Lightbulb vacuum triodes
0 kelvin is absence of thermal energy. 247 kelvin is 0celsius
thermionic emission is emission of electrons from a heated surface
this led to vacuum diode, which could rectify AC
signal amplification is increasing amplitude, so further distances and less noise
vacuum diode was first electrical switch used in first digital computer ENIAC

## Jumping Robot
Rubber can store tremendous amounts of elastic energy (also why used for tires as can be deformed)
Carbon fibre high strength-to-weight ratio (graphene best)
Interesting observations of bush-baby muscle attachments leading to robot design

## Analog Computing
Analog computers such as the antikythera mechanism can use gears, with each tooth representing a value (often mechanical devices) to measure orbits. Also tides
Analog errors are easy to occur and can multiply, also as models of the real world, not general purpose.
So, digital more noise-resilient, general-purpose and easily made as same components

Multiplying 32bit numbers may require hundreds of transistors for digital
Analog could just add two currents and apply resistor easily.
So, in come cases, analog better as less components and less power.
Success of neural networks is their size. So, require large amounts of power and memory to train
In fact, neural networks effectively boil down to matrix multiplication
By storing certain amount of electrons and applying a certain voltage, output currents can be added together
Size of transistor approaching size of atom, so Moore's law ending

Relatively low-pressure can get high force if over a large area

Such large nuclei of uranium, plutonium make nuclei unstable. 
Isotopes (different neutrons) can be more radioactive than others
Half-life is exponentially decreasing constant (uranium into lead in 4.5billion years)

Diesel more efficient and no sparkplug, but heavy engine, so not in high-performance.
Used in larger vehicles like fire trucks

If rub garlic on feet, can taste as it goes into bloodstream

# FFT
Convert from time-domain into frequency-domain to divide signal into various subcarrier frequencies.
This allows to send parallel data, i.e. higher bandwidth in 5G
FFT developed to detect nuclear testing
Thermonuclear/hydrogen bomb first uses fission which triggers fusion
Peace sign made by combining semaphores of N and D (nucler deterrant)
Around 55 earthquakes a day
So, FFT to have fast way determining underground nuclear tests

# Ground
Voltage is difference between two points. Ground is reference voltage (as in say a CPU, there is no literal ground)

x11 requires window manager (from desktop environment like xfce, gnome (gtk), kde (qt)); compositor all in one
x11 siphoned input, graphics, fonts and indirect communication etc. 
wayland and mor are compositors
