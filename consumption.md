## Blue Mountains
Blue mountains bordered by the Nepean river to the east, Coxs to the south and Wolgan to the north.
The Nepean river rises around Mittagong and merges with the Hawkesbury at Agnes Banks.
The Coxs river merges with Lake Burragorang
The original great western railway through the Blue Mountains utilised zig-zagging tracks at Lapstone and Lithgow.
This was to avoid cost of building tunnels.
As Blue Mountains elevated, air pressure less, so less dense, so less energy and ability to absorb solar radiation.

Human body mainly oxygen, carbon (stable bonding for organic life), hydrogen and nitrogen (amino acids)
We get our nitrogen from animals or plants. Low nitrogen, low crop yields.
Resowing removes nitrogen from soil, so originally used guano (bird poo)
Haber process creates ammonia from atmosphere rich in nitrogen (though strongly connected via triple bond)
So, Haber process responsible for sustaining such large populations through ammonium nitrate fertiliser
However, ammonium nitrate is also an explosive
