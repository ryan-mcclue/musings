the sparsity of linux can make configuration vary
e.g bluez stack -> modify policies

for long range, LoRa or sigfox
essentially tradeoffs between power and data rate
ieee 802.11 group for WANs (wifi - high data rate), 
802.15 for WPANs; 802.15.1 (bluetooth - le variant - heavily used in audio), 
802.15.4 low data rate (zigbee implements this standard)


source and unit tests are documentation in many linux sources

xor with itself sets to 0
